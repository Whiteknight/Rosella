Several parts of Rosella, specifically the xunit-based tests, parts of the
mock object library, and several individual routines throughout are based on
the work of Austin Hastings in the Kakapo project.

Parts of the tap_harness library are influenced by the TAPIR project by
Jonathan Leto and the distutils library by Fran√ßois Perrad.
