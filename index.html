            A collection of tools and building blocks for the Parrot Virtual
            Machine.
        </div>

        <p>
            Rosella is a library of patterns and practices for use with the
            Parrot Virtual Machine. The goal of Rosella is to provide a
            library of building blocks for programmers on Parrot. By having
            these tools and components available in a portable, usable way,
            programmers should be empowered to create high quality,
            maintainable software faster.

            The Rosella project is actually a collection of individual
            libraries, each of which implements a single pattern or best
            practice. Rosella is intended to be used piece-wise. Use only the
            parts you want and ignore the parts you do not want. Rosella
            libraries tend not to be interdependent, although some of the more
            advanced libraries rely on some of the more basic ones.
        </p>

        <h2>Rosella Components</h2>

        <h3>Rosella Stable Libraries</h3>

        <p>
            Here is a list of Rosella's libraries which are currently
            considered to be "stable" enough for general use:
        </p>

        <h4>Core</h4>
        <p>
            Rosella's Core library provides a handful of routines used by
            the other Rosella libraries. This library provides basic behavior
            for working with an assortment of "type" meta-objects, and for
            implementing a standard system of object constructor behavior.
        </p>

        <h4>Action</h4>
        <p>
            The Action library implements the Command pattern. Sequences of
            instructions can be bundled together into an Action object, and
            can be invoked later.
        </p>

        <h4>Container</h4>
        <p>
            The Container library implements a Dependency Injection, Inversion
            of Control container type which can be used to help decouple
            modules in a program. The Container utilizes the Action library
            to setup constructor injection and method injection behaviors
            on registered types.
        </p>

        <h4>Test</h4>
        <p>
            Inspired by testing libraries such as xUnit and Test::More,
            The Rosella Test library provides the tools and utilities to
            quickly write unit tests for your software. Rosella's own test
            suite is written using this library.
        </p>

        <h4>TAP Harness</h4>
        <p>
            A companion to the Test library, The TAP Harness library
            implements the logic necessary to quickly construct a TAP harness
            for executing unit tests and reporting the results. Rosella's own
            test harness is written using this library.
        </p>

        <h4>Proxy</h4>
        <p>
            The Proxy library provides the tools necessary to create a wide
            array of proxy objects.
        </p>

        <h4>Mock Objects</h4>
        <p>
            The MockObject library uses the Rosella Proxy library to implement
            full-featured mock objects for use in testing with the Test
            library. Several tests in the Rosella test suite are implemented
            using this library.
        </p>

        <h3>Rosella Development Libraries</h3>

        <p>
            This is a list of libraries which are still in design or
            development phases:
        </p>

        <h4>Event</h4>
        <p>
            The Event library provides a subscribe/observe interface over the
            Action library. Multiple parts of a program can anonymously
            subscribe to or publish named events. This library is inspired,
            in part, by the event aggregation portions of the PRISM practices
            library.
        </p>

        <h4>Prototype</h4>
        <p>
            The Prototype library provides facilities for implementing a
            prototype-based object model system. Prototypes and object
            constructors/initializers can be registered with the library. New
            instances can be cloned from the prototype on demand.
        </p>

        <h4>Query</h4>
        <p>
            The Query library provides interfaces for interacting with
            aggregate objects. This library provides a series of higher-order
            utilities inspired by the .Net LINQ library.
        </p>

        <h4>Decorate</h4>
        <p>
            The Decorate library uses the Proxy library to implement a system
            of cheap, efficient type decorators. A decorator allows
            transparent passthrough of normal method calls, attribute
            accesses, and primitive value operations while allowing the
            programmer to inject additional methods and attributes on a
            per-object (not per-class) basis.
        </p>

        <h4>Contract</h4>
        <p>
            The Contract library implements logic for "design by contract"
            programming mechanisms. You can set up runtime checks for pre-
            and post-conditions on method calls, and you can set up assertions
            to verify invariant conditions. All the logic in the library can
            be disabled once the software has been tested and deployed.
        </p>

        <h2>Install</h2>

        <h3>Dependencies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://github.com/parrot/parrot">Parrot</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/winxed">Winxed</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Installing With Plumage</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="http://github.com/parrot/plumage">Plumage</a> is a
            package-management program for Parrot. If you have Plumage
            and Winxed already installed getting Rosella is a breeze:
        </p>
        <pre>
$ plumage install rosella</pre>
        <p>
            That's all there is to it! You now have Rosella. If you don't have
            Plumage on your system you'll need to follow the rest of the
            instructions below.
