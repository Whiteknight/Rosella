## Overview

The Rosella Path library provides the ability to search for values in nested
aggregate objects with a single path string. This string-based recursive
search is useful in situations where we need to decouple the use of a complex
data object from its internal structure.

The Path library provides one class with one method of interest:
`Rosella.Path` and its `get` method. `Path` is an object type that brings
together the logic and state information to perform a search, and the `get`
method performs the search, returning a value.
