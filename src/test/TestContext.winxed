        methods in the test class. It can be used to store data between tests,
        and also provides access to data about the running test suite and
        holds information about the currently-executing test.

        /* Test Helpers
            These routines are provided by the default TestContext as an aide
            for running tests. These are not required for normal running of
            the Suite, and can be optionally disallowed or overridden in
            custom Context objects.

            Notice that if you don't provide some of these things, they won't
            be available to running tests. For instance, this is the only
            mechanism for marking a test as todo'd, so if you take that away
            you won't be able to use that.
